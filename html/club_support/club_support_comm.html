<p>The Club Support committee is comprised of student Senate and non-Senate members dedicated to assisting 
clubs through the club formation process. Club Support is also happy to assist club leaders whenever they
have a problem related to continuing to run their clubs. Any questions related to club money or finances
should be sent to <a href="mailto:clubfinance@brandeis.edu">clubfinance@brandeis.edu</a>. Other emails can 
be sent to this year's Club Support committee chair, <a href="mailto:drherb17@brandeis.edu">David Herbstritt</a>.
Feel free to look at the documents below as a guide for starting a club or maintaining a club, and please fill out and hand in an anti-hazing and club renewal form
if your club has yet to do so. Other information and forms can be found at 
<a href="http://www.brandeis.edu/clubs/">http://www.brandeis.edu/clubs/</a>.</p>
