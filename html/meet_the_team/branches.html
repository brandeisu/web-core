	Knowing your Student Union is important in voicing yourself, and absolutely essential in club creation and
	financing. Which senators represent your class and residential hall? Who can you speak to about making a new 
	club? Senate committees also represent several causes such as dining and sustainability, and meet 
	regularly with faculty on these topics and issues.
	<br />The Union has four major branches: the Executive Board, the Allocations Board, and the Judiciary.
	Each has rights and responsibilities as set forth by the Constitution.
