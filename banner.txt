Modeled after /admissions, blue_recolored in addition to blue_strip makes the background for #blue_strip.

Attempt 1: I tried to discriminate pixels as white (-->absolute white) or blue (-->transparent).
([i]<=382) discriminated by the red value. This absolutism led to poor, rough edges.

Attempt 2: Draw blue_recolored and blue_strip, then try to consolidate the pixels.
1. Draw blue_recolored at an offset, and get the data (PicData).
2. Draw blue_strip at an offset elsewhere, and get the data (TextData).
3. Consolidate the data: PicData=(white-T)*
4. Put PicData.
